Getting started
---------------

To try this code on your local machine you will need to have an xmpp
server. [Prosody](http://prosody.im/) is a good choice for
developement purpose. Once you have an XMPP server you should create a
few users and add them in their respective roster via an xmpp client.

Then, install the dependencies and run the server:

    $ npm install
    $ node server.js

and open your browser at http://localhost:5000/
